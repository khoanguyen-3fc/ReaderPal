- [ ] Bookmarking feature
- [ ] Highlighting and note-taking tools

## Important Note

To utilize the AI companion feature, you'll need to supply your own OpenAI API key. We assure you that this key is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage and is not transmitted to any server, except for OpenAI's API.

Please be aware that our AI companion is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3, a sophisticated language model. While it's capable of generating human-like text, it may occasionally produce responses that are incorrect or inappropriate.

"The JWT Handbook" by Sebasti√°n E. Peyrott, Auth0 Inc. is included as a sample book for demonstration purposes only.

Happy reading with ReaderPal!
